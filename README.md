## Description

It is my Portfolio homepage. This portfolio represents the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections "about me", "my work", and how to "contact me". The webpage uses CSS3 with a responsive layout that adapts to any viewport. I am proud of the work, in which I only use CSS3 for design and responsive layout. 

The UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developed applications. When the link is clicked it will take to that deployed application's live website. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
